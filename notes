The getElementsByClassName()
 method returns a collection of all elements in the document with the specified class name, as an HTMLCollection object.
The HTMLCollection object represents a collection of nodes. The nodes can be accessed by index numbers. The index starts at 0.
Tip: You can use the length property of the HTMLCollection object to determine the number of elements with a specified class name, then you can loop through all elements and extract the info you want.


Slideshow

First, set the slideIndex to 1. (First picture)

Then call showDivs() to display the first image.

When the user clicks one of the buttons call plusDivs().

The plusDivs() function subtracts one or  adds one to the slideIndex.

The showDiv() function hides (display="none") all elements with the class name "mySlides", and displays (display="block") the element with the given slideIndex.

If the slideIndex is higher than the number of elements (x.length), the slideIndex is set to zero.

If the slideIndex is less than 1 it is set to number of elements (x.length).
